        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to <span class='special'>leSketchJS</span>! An as-you-see-it digital painting application<br>
          Use this manual to learn the features of this application. Information found here is subject to update.<br>

        <h1>The Editor</h1>
        <p>
          SimpleSketchJS can essentially be broken down into two sections: The <span class="important">Workspace</span> and the <span class='important'>User Interface</span>.<br>
          The Workspace is where the art happens! To the lower left you'll find the current zoom level which can be adjusted.<br>
          The User Interface is where you'll find the tools, page dimensions, layers and color palette.<br>
          Of course these work in tandem. The minimal design should provide clarity to their uses.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>The Workspace</h1>
        <p>
          The Workspace hosts the <span class="important">Draw Space</span> which is the drawable region within the workspace.<br>
          The Draw Space starts with a transparent background (the checkerbox design). All brush related actions are performed within<br>
          the Draw Space. Performing a "Mouse Wheel" or "Scroll" action whilst in the workspace will adjust the zoom. <br>
          Users can also manually adjust the zoom by typing in the desired zoom in the lower left side of the workspace.
        </p>
